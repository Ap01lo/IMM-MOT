## ðŸ”»Abstract

This work introduces an improved 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) method called IMM-MOT. To address the limitation of existing approaches that rely on a single motion model and struggle to adapt to complex object motion changes, IMM-MOT integrates the **Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter**. The IMM filter dynamically combines multiple motion models to more accurately fit an object's movement patterns. Additionally, a **Damping Window mechanism** is incorporated into trajectory lifecycle management, utilizing an object's continuous association status to control trajectory initiation and termination, thereby reducing missed detections of low-confidence true targets. Furthermore, a **Distance-Based Score Enhancement module** is proposed, which adjusts detection confidence scores to better distinguish between true and false positives, enhancing the effectiveness of the score filter. Collectively, these three innovations in IMM-MOT overcome the limitations of traditional methods, improving tracking accuracy and robustness.



## ðŸ¥ŸResults

All the results are tested on the NuScenes Dataset. We didn't make a large scale experiments on Test set because we can't reproduce the published result on Test set of Poly-MOT. And the suitable parameters need batches of experiments. So we just validate the IMM Module on the Test set using the reproduced result.

## ðŸ“ƒUsage

>  **ðŸ“¢Notice**: The implement of IMM-MOT project is partly based on [Poly-MOT](https://github.com/lixiaoyu2000/Poly-MOT). What we did is to expand some modules. So the entire usage, including the structure and config file, is similar to [Poly-MOT](https://github.com/lixiaoyu2000/Poly-MOT).
>
> The main changes are as follows:
>
> 1. We add DBSE module in the  `IMM/pre_processing/dbss.py`, and you can find the entry in the `IMM/dataloader/nusc_loader.py`.
> 2. We add IMM module in the `IMM/motion_module/kalman_filter.py`. 
> 3. We add DW module in the `IMM/tracking/nusc_score_manage.py`. 
> 4. All the changes are presented in the configure file `IMM/config/nusc_config.yaml`.
> 5. We set different parameters for different object type. Check the code for more details.



#### 1. Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate imm
```

#### 2. Data preparation

First download the [NuScenes Dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#download).

Our work uses 3D detector (especially Lidar-only detector) and please download the detection file in the corresponding website like [CenterPoint](https://github.com/tianweiy/CenterPoint) and [Largekernel](https://github.com/dvlab-research/LargeKernel3D). The CenterPoint detection file we use is downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oGgi2RXZWnVJeCDK9G4PKaYNMjT2V6BO). Note that CenterPoint for NuScenes Val set and Largekernel for Test set. 

Then run the following instruction to exact the first frame table:

```bash
cd IMM/data/script
python first_frame.py
```

The result will be output in `IMM/data/utils/first_token_table/{version}/nusc_first_token.json`.

Then run the following instructions to reorder the detection file with the first token table we have got above.

```bash
cd IMM/data/script
python reorder_detection.py
```

The result will be output in `IMM/data/detector`.

> ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ Before running all the instructions please check all the paths and ensure they are correct.

#### 3. Running and Evaluation

All the parameters are presented in `config/nusc_config.yaml`. Change the value to customize the tracker.

```BASH
python test.py
```

Run the `test.py` to start the tracking process, and the evaluation stage will start directly after tracking.
